Hi!

Here, you'll find examples of multiple single-trial regressions on reaction time and logistic regression on accuracy.

The example in Regression_on_Behavior.m is based on this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07456-8">dataset</a>

Let me know if you encounter any problems.

Cheers,
Hans
